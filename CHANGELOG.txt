# V 0.2 update

- Fixed a couple of minor bugs
- Added support for CAMPARI's 'dash' (-) seperated PDB columns
- Changed default behaviour such that non-standard AA are skipped and printed to STDERR. This means you can parse a PDB
  file which has other atoms in it and they'll be skipped. Obviously the default is that if you run this the errors appear
  in the terminal because STDERR and STDOUT both pipe to the terminal BUT it means if you know you can ignore such amino acids
  you can pipe STDERR to /dev/null and get on with you life.
